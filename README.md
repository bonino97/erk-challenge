# EurekaChallenge - Frontend Engineer

## Project Description

This project is built using Vite along with React Router for routing, embracing modern React patterns with Hooks & Contexts for state management.

## Installation

To install dependencies, run:

```bash
yarn install
```

To launch the application, run:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## Libraries

This project makes use of the following libraries:

- **React Query**: for server state management in React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: for a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **Heroicons**: for beautifully hand-crafted SVG icons.

## Live Demo

- Add tests to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
- Further decouple components for better maintainability and reusability.
